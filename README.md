# Customer Churn Modeling of Telco Company Customer Dataset
Customer churn analysis is an important topic and when an existing customer, user, subscriber, or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company.

In this project we will investigate the Telco company customer dataset and would like to get some insights about the customers. 

Our objective in here is to analyze this customer data and develop a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

## General Information
The churn analysis as the whole of analytical studies on “a customer”, “a product or service”, and “the probability of abandonment”.

For this project, we will be analysing and then modeling the Telco company customer dataset in order to understand the results, and we will try to check our data model. 

## Setup
We will use "telco_dataset.csv" data in here. You can find our data in our resources section.

## Usage
In this project our goal is to work through this notebook to help our sample company Telco company or another company to understand if they develop a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

If you try to answer some same questions in your another company, you can use this project as a template for yourself.
